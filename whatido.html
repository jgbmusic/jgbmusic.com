		<h1>What I Can Do For You</h1>
		<p>I specialize in arranging instrumental or vocal parts to existing public domain works.  I try to avoid dealing with copywritten works because the legwork involved is overwhelming.  However, if you have a piece in mind, and have acquired the appropriate permissions (and can provide copies of said documents), I would LOVE to work with you.</p>
		<p>My goal is to provide rapid-turnaround services for smaller jobs.  Say you are a music director at a church, and you have a saxophone player returning from college over Christmas break, and you think it would be neat to have her play along on a hymn--but you just don't have the time to transpose the melody to E-flat... let alone create an embellished part to accompany the congregation.</p>  
		<p>That's where I come in--in these cases, I can provide you a professionally printed part on durable paper stock for $20-25.  If you're local, I can probably get that to you in 24-48 hours of your first phone call or e-mail. See my <a href = "fees.html">"Fees"</a> page for more information.</p>
