		<h1>Hobbies & Stuff</h1>
		<p>I like to spend as much time with my wife and infant son as I can.  We enjoyed hiking in the nearby Santa Monica Mountains while we lived in California, try to participate as much
		as possible at our church, geocaching <a href= http://www.geocaching.com>(http://www.geocaching.com)</a>, cooking, and traveling.</p>
		
		<p>I am also available to substitute on piano at your church (Rankin, Hinds, and Scott counties)--either contemporary or traditional liturgy.  With a little bit more advance notice, my wife can join me on flute to further augment your services (we just need time to find a babysitter :)  She's an accomplished flutist of more than 20 years, as the principal flute in the Ventura County Concert Band, and most recently, recording an album with the concept band Aepsylon.</p>
		<p>I also have some other hobbies, including basic website design.  I've done a couple, including this one, and another neat one: <a href=http://www.redwoodsea.com>
		The Redwood Sea</a>.  I maintain our <a href= http://www.brooks-family.net>family site</a> as well--you'll need the user name <strong>"guest"</strong> and password <strong>"sunflower"</strong> to get in.  If you like these, I might be able to help you out with your domain too.  Let me know--it's another fun hobby of mine, so while I haven't set 
		rates for it, let's talk!</p>
