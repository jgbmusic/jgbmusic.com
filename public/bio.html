		<h1>A Little About Me...</h1>
		<p>I have a Bachelor's of Music from James Madison University ('92) where I studied piano.  I wanted to be an audio engineer, but upon arriving in Los Angeles, I discovered that you don't
		need a 4-year degree to do that--you need to be willing to push a broom in a studio for a year or two.  That's not me.  </p>
		<p>I then "retooled" myself, earning a Master's of Engineering from California State
		University, Northridge and am currently employed in the Defense Industry.  This affords
		me the opportunity to play with music on a freelance basis.</p>
		<p>Along the way,  I spent 9 years as the Music Director of Faith Lutheran Church in 
		Moorpark, CA.  By the time I left (to spend more time with our newborn son!), I was coordinating, directing, playing, writing and arranging for a Flute Choir, a Brass Ensemble, an Adult Choir, a Children's Choir and a contemporary band, as well as providing music for weekly services.  For a few years, I freelanced as a pianist in various churches in Ventura County a couple times a month.  </p>
		<p>Now we live in a suburb of Jackson, Mississippi, and within the first few months, I signed on as a rhythm guitarist in a contemporary band at Lakeside Presbyterian Church in Brandon.  </p>
		<p>I play a wide range of instruments at a number of levels.  Piano is primary, and I would rate myself as semi-pro.  I do get paid for my work.  I have also performed in ensembles (no solo work) on trumpet, french horn (single), mellophone, clarinet (B-flat, E-flat alto, and Bass) and voice at an intermediate level.  I also like to play around with guitar, mandolin, and bouzouki, although those are my novice/beginner level ones.  I goof around with the flute sometimes, although that is my wife's domain--she's an excellent semi-pro, and was the principal flute in our flute choir, as well as principal in the Ventura County Concert Band for several years.
